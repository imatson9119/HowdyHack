# Hungry Ags
This project was developed in 24 hours for HowdyHack 2019. It is a web application that allows student organizations at Texas A&M to post events that are offering free food (specifically, recruiting events). This way, Aggies who are looking for free food are able to find a meal, and organizations looking for members get to pitch their organization to more potential members. It's a win-win!

# Solution
Hungry Ags was developed using the Angular web framework for the front-end. Google Firebase is used for hosting and for the database (Firebase Realtime Database), and Node.js was used to write some server-side functions that execute when various events occur on the site (i.e. registering a new org).

For the entire team, this was one of our first experiences building a fully functional web application using Angular (with a proper back-end), and it was a valuable learning experience. The app is currently hosted at [hungry-ags.web.app](https://hungry-ags.web.app/home) if you would like to check out some of the functionality for yourself!
