            Event submission is the backbone of Hungry Ags. Currently, we allow any registered Google account to submit events. Consequently, some general guidelines are required in
            order to maintain quality submissions. These can be observed below:
            <ul>
                <li>Obscene or foul language is not to be used when submitting events. All submissions should be suitable for any audience.</li>
                <li>All events submitted must contain free food.</li>
                <li>No personal information may be shared.</li>
            </ul>
            Violation of any one of these guidelines can result in an immidate termination of your account. If you have any questions, feel free to contact <b>support@hungryags.com</b>
            <br><br><br>
            <b>Tips on submitting your events:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your description concise- a long excessive paragraph can lose the intrest of readers!</li>
                <li>Including the type of food your event will serve can be helpful to those using the filtering tools.</li>
                <li>If you use a valid Texas A&M Building code (HRBB, MSC, ect.) somewhere in your event location, a map icon will display on your event to allow users
                    to easily view it on a map.
                </li>
                <li>If you make a mistake when submitting your event or the event is cancelled, clicking on one of your own events will display the options to either
                    edit or delete the event.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Registering your organization is an easy process designed to help you to get the most out of Hungry Ags. To register your organization, simply fill out the registration
            form and submit. Once a registration request is submitted, our team will contact the corrosponding organization
            to ensure the validity of the request. Upon receiving confirmation, we will then register your account as a verified organization. Since this process is manually reviewed,
            it may take up to a few days.
            <br><br>
            Once your organization has been registered, you can expect to see the following changes:
            <ul>
                <li>Events will display a verified badge to distinguish your events from individual ones.</li>
                <li>The email of the registered account will be displayed at the bottom of your events to allow users 
                    to communicate any questions they may have concerning the event.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <div class = 'section-header'>Using the Calendar</div>
            <br>
            The event calendar is designed to be simplistic and user-friendly- you can browse dates with the arrows and click on any event to reveal specific details. The
            main view has a couple of great features. Verified events (events that are directly reported and sponsored by organizations) can be easily distinguished
            by a maroon circle next to the name. The filter bar allows users to narrow the displayed events to ones that contain any given word or phrase, enabling searchability by food, 
            location, organization, and description.
            <br><br>
            The event view is where you can get most of the information regarding any event, as well as perform a few actions:
            <ul>
                <li>Edit your events</li>
                <li>Delete your events</li>
                <li>Report an event</li>
                <li>Show an event on a map (If the location contains an A&M building code; MSC, HRBB, ect)</li>
            </ul>
